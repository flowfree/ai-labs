To show up to your pity potties and your pity parades If you ever see me in a Rolls Royce A six or seven star hotel living my life to the fullest Don't get jealous of me Cause I worked my ass off to get it Nobody handed me nothing Wake your ass up Awaken the beast inside It's game on It's go season It's time for you to take advantage of the access and the resources that you have In your country and your community. You got a problem with your life You got a problem with your environment Do something about it if you want it go get it Recognize the excuses are not valid They're conjured up they're fabricated they're lies And how do you stop the lies you stop the lies with the truth, but The truth is you have time. You have the skill. You have the knowledge and the worthwhile. And it's not going to come to you, and it's not going to fall in your lap, and it's not going to be something that, oh my gosh, it just was so simple. It's always going to be difficult. If you want it, you gotta go get it. This is your chance. This is your shot. This is your moment. This is your time. This is your place This is your opportunity. It's my time. It's my moment tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow Ain't no such thing as tomorrow. We only got today in Joe dream if you want to have it get your butt up and make it happen if you want to have it rise and grind You still got work to do? Stay on that basketball court. Stay on that football field. It's grind season, homie. you\"}"
